## Title
Computational validation of a psoriasis-relevant cosmeceutical: transcriptomic reversal, pathway opposition, and topical plausibility

## Abstract (draft after results)

## Introduction
- Psoriasis pathways (IL-17/TNF/NF-ÎºB; keratinocyte biology)
- Cosmeceutical actives (CBD, lutein, tulsi; rationale)

## Methods
- Datasets and preprocessing
- Differential expression and GSEA
- Target/process mapping & PPI
- Connectivity mapping
- ADMET/permeation heuristics
- Docking sanity checks (optional)

## Results
- F2: DE + hallmark/Reactome enrichments
- F3: Overlap & PPI hubs
- F4: Connectivity reversal
- F5: ADMET/permeation panel
- (Optional F6) Docking snapshot + mini-MD

## Discussion
- Mechanistic plausibility; limitations; next steps

## Data & Code Availability
- GEO accessions; this repository link
